  3. Third H2 from the app [450 words]

Hard rules for this page:
- Never invent a number, a price, a client result, a certification, a credential or a capability. If it is not in the client facts, the evidence or a Live Research result, do not write it.
- Do not write an author line, a testimonial block, a breadcrumb, a related links block or a FAQ. Those are produced separately.
- No exclamation marks.

CTA:
The final section closes with a call to action paragraph that follows this rule: CTA rule sent by the app. Link the action to https://example.com/contact/ with a plain anchor of two to four words. No button, no heading.
