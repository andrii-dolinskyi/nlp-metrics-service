Page type: Location (local family). Physical branch, office, clinic or store
Client: Example Client
What the client does: What the client does, as sent by the app.
H1 (use verbatim): Sample H1 sent by the app
Core keyword: sample core keyword
Secondary keywords: secondary one, secondary two
Language: write in English.

Structure:
- Opening paragraph: A location-specific H1 and the facts of this place: address, hours, what is offered here. Not a definitional answer paragraph. Then begin the first H2.
- Then these H2 sections, in this exact order, with these exact headings. Do not add, merge, rename or reorder sections. H3 subheadings inside a section are allowed where they help.
  1. First H2 from the app [198 words]
  2. Second H2 from the app [198 words, as a markdown table with a header row]
  3. Third H2 from the app [198 words]
  4. Fourth H2 from the app [198 words]
- Preferred formats for this page type, where a section has no format of its own: prose (as prose), bullets (as a short bulleted list).
- Total length: 500 to 1200 words. Aim for about 850.
- Tables are optional. Use one only where it helps the reader.
- External citations are optional. Any you use must come from the Live Research tool.
- Research: This page type is written from the client facts and general professional knowledge. Use the Live Research tool only when a sentence needs a specific external figure or quote, and drop the sentence if nothing reliable comes back.
- Every H2 section opens with a sentence that answers that section directly, then explains, then evidences.
- Each section has its own job. Say a thing once, in the section where it belongs. A client fact appears where it is relevant and at most twice on the whole page. Never recycle facts to reach a word budget; when a section needs more substance, explain the subject itself: how the practice works, what varies from case to case, what a reader should check, what goes wrong and why.

Questions this page must answer:
Readers and answer engines ask these questions. Answer each one once, inside the section where it fits best, with a direct answering sentence first and the evidence after it. Never insert a question as text, never add a question and answer block, never restate the question. The reader must not notice the question was planted.

Client facts:
These are the only claims you may make about the client. Use them exactly and invent nothing about the client beyond them. General knowledge about the field, the practice and what buyers should look for is welcome and must never be phrased as a claim about the client.
- fact_key_1: fact value from the app
- fact_key_2: ["list","of","values"]

Hard rules for this page:
- Never invent a number, a price, a client result, a certification, a credential or a capability. If it is not in the client facts or in a Live Research result you saw, do not write it.
- Do not write an author line, a testimonial block, a breadcrumb, a related links block or a FAQ. Those are produced separately.
- No exclamation marks.
- Page type constraints: NAP and hours only from the facts.

- External citations are optional. Any you use must come from the Live Research tool.
- Research: This page type is written from the client facts and general professional knowledge. Use the Live Research tool only when a sentence needs a specific external figure or quote, and drop the sentence if nothing reliable comes back.
- Every H2 section opens with a sentence that answers that section directly, then explains, then evidences.
- Each section has its own job. Say a thing once, in the section where it belongs. A client fact appears where it is relevant and at most twice on the whole page. Never recycle facts to reach a word budget; when a section needs more substance, explain the subject itself: how the practice works, what varies from case to case, what a reader should check, what goes wrong and why.

Questions this page must answer:
Readers and answer engines ask these questions. Answer each one once, inside the section where it fits best, with a direct answering sentence first and the evidence after it. Never insert a question as text, never add a question and answer block, never restate the question. The reader must not notice the question was planted.
  1. First AI prompt sent by the app?
  2. Second AI prompt sent by the app?

Internal links:
Place every one of these exactly once, in body text, with the given anchor or a natural variant of it. Never in the H1, the opening paragraph, a heading, a table or a list of links. Never invent any other internal link.
  - https://example.com/published-page/ (anchor: anchor text from the app)

Client facts:
These are the only claims you may make about the client. Use them exactly and invent nothing about the client beyond them. General knowledge about the field, the practice and what buyers should look for is welcome and must never be phrased as a claim about the client.
- fact_key_1: fact value from the app
- fact_key_2: ["list","of","values"]

Hard rules for this page:
- Never invent a number, a price, a client result, a certification, a credential or a capability. If it is not in the client facts or in a Live Research result you saw, do not write it.
- Do not write an author line, a testimonial block, a breadcrumb, a related links block or a FAQ. Those are produced separately.
- No exclamation marks.


CTA:
The final section closes with a call to action paragraph that follows this rule: CTA rule sent by the app. Link the action to https://example.com/contact/ with a plain anchor of two to four words. No button, no heading.
