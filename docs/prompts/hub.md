<page_brief>
Page type: Pillar hub (hub family). Broad topic overview that summarises and links every cluster page
Client: Example Client
What the client does: What the client does, as sent by the app.
H1 (use verbatim): Sample H1 sent by the app
Core keyword: sample core keyword
Secondary keywords: secondary one, secondary two
Language: write in English.

Structure:
- Opening paragraph: a direct answer of 40 to 80 words in the key facts style (A two to four sentence scope statement, then grouped links with one or two sentence blurbs). No heading above it, no preamble. It answers the question the H1 implies.
- Then these H2 sections, in this exact order, with these exact headings. Do not add, merge, rename or reorder sections. H3 subheadings inside a section are allowed where they help.
  1. First H2 from the app [450 words]
  2. Second H2 from the app [450 words, as a markdown table with a header row]
  3. Third H2 from the app [450 words]
  4. Fourth H2 from the app [450 words]
- Preferred formats for this page type, where a section has no format of its own: cards (as short titled blocks), bullets (as a short bulleted list).
- Total length: 2000 to 5000 words. Aim for about 2500.
- Include at least 2 markdown table where a section suits one. Real pipe tables with a header row.
- Include at least 5 external citations as markdown links to URLs that appear in the evidence section. Name the source and the year in the sentence.
- Every H2 section opens with a sentence that answers that section directly, then explains, then evidences.
- Each section has its own job. Say a thing once, in the section where it belongs. A client fact appears where it is relevant and at most twice on the whole page. Never recycle facts to reach a word budget; when a section needs more substance, explain the subject itself: how the practice works, what varies from case to case, what a reader should check, what goes wrong and why.

Questions this page must answer:
Readers and answer engines ask these questions. Answer each one once, inside the section where it fits best, with a direct answering sentence first and the evidence after it. Never insert a question as text, never add a question and answer block, never restate the question. The reader must not notice the question was planted.

  2. Second AI prompt sent by the app?

Client facts:
These are the only claims you may make about the client. Use them exactly and invent nothing about the client beyond them. General knowledge about the field, the practice and what buyers should look for is welcome and must never be phrased as a claim about the client.

- fact_key_2: ["list","of","values"]

Hard rules for this page:

<page_brief>
Page type: Integration directory (hub family). Index of integration pages by category
Client: Example Client
What the client does: What the client does, as sent by the app.
H1 (use verbatim): Sample H1 sent by the app
Core keyword: sample core keyword
Secondary keywords: secondary one, secondary two
Language: write in English.

Structure:
- Opening paragraph: A two to four sentence scope statement, then grouped links with one or two sentence blurbs. Not a definitional answer paragraph. Then begin the first H2.
- Then these H2 sections, in this exact order, with these exact headings. Do not add, merge, rename or reorder sections. H3 subheadings inside a section are allowed where they help.
  1. First H2 from the app [122 words]
  2. Second H2 from the app [122 words, as a markdown table with a header row]
  3. Third H2 from the app [122 words]
  4. Fourth H2 from the app [122 words]
- Preferred formats for this page type, where a section has no format of its own: cards (as short titled blocks), bullets (as a short bulleted list).
- Total length: 300 to 800 words. Aim for about 550.
- Tables are optional. Use one only where it helps the reader.
- External citations are optional and must come from the evidence section or the Live Research tool.
- Every H2 section opens with a sentence that answers that section directly, then explains, then evidences.
- Each section has its own job. Say a thing once, in the section where it belongs. A client fact appears where it is relevant and at most twice on the whole page. Never recycle facts to reach a word budget; when a section needs more substance, explain the subject itself: how the practice works, what varies from case to case, what a reader should check, what goes wrong and why.

Questions this page must answer:
Readers and answer engines ask these questions. Answer each one once, inside the section where it fits best, with a direct answering sentence first and the evidence after it. Never insert a question as text, never add a question and answer block, never restate the question. The reader must not notice the question was planted.

  2. Second AI prompt sent by the app?

Internal links:

Client facts:
These are the only claims you may make about the client. Use them exactly and invent nothing about the client beyond them. General knowledge about the field, the practice and what buyers should look for is welcome and must never be phrased as a claim about the client.
- fact_key_1: fact value from the app
- fact_key_2: ["list","of","values"]

Hard rules for this page:
- Never invent a number, a price, a client result, a certification, a credential or a capability. If it is not in the client facts, the evidence or a Live Research result, do not write it.
- Do not write an author line, a testimonial block, a breadcrumb, a related links block or a FAQ. Those are produced separately.
- No exclamation marks.
