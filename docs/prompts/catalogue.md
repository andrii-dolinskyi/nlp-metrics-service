# Writer page briefs: `catalogue` family (26 types)

Rendered with the standard sample request described in [README.md](README.md). Lines that come from the spec row are the ones to review.

## `product_page` (Product)

Spec: {"words_min": 300, "words_max": 1200, "default_words": 750, "answer_paragraph": false, "answer_style": "none", "tables_min": 1, "citations_min": 0, "research": "none", "closing_mode": "none", "cta_mode": "optional", "h3_policy": "optional: one H3 per variant inside a section that covers several.", "schema_types": "Product + Offer + AggregateRating + BreadcrumbList"}

```text
<page_brief>
Page type: Product (catalogue family). Single product
Client: Example Client
What the client does: What the client does, as sent by the app.
H1 (use verbatim): Sample H1 sent by the app
Core keyword: sample core keyword
Secondary keywords: secondary one, secondary two
Language: write in English.

Structure:
- Opening paragraph: The item's title and key facts. Not a definitional answer paragraph. Then begin the first H2.
- Then these H2 sections, in this exact order, with these exact headings. Do not add, merge, rename or reorder them.
  1. First H2 from the app [172 words]
  2. Second H2 from the app [172 words]
  3. Third H2 from the app [172 words]
  4. Fourth H2 from the app [172 words] (this is the closing section, see below)
  The last section above is the closing section. Content: the one decision or action the reader should take now, in 60 to 120 words, without recapping the page
- Formats for this page type: Specifications, prices, sizes, doses, coverage and comparisons in tables. Sequences as numbered steps. Inclusions and options as bullets. Descriptions and reasoning in prose. Decide per section from what the heading asks for. Never put a table where prose answers the heading, never pad a section with bullets, and never write a list of one or two items.
- Include at least 1 markdown table where a section suits one. Real pipe tables with a header row.
- H3 subheadings are optional: one H3 per variant inside a section that covers several. When you use H3s in a section, use at least two, phrase each as the specific sub-question or item it covers (that is what answer engines quote), keep them in sentence case, and never put an H3 in a section under 150 words. Never use H4.
- Total length: 300 to 1200 words. Aim for about 750.
- External citations are optional. Any you use must come from the Live Research tool.
- Research: This page type is written from the client facts and general professional knowledge. Use the Live Research tool only when a sentence needs a specific external figure or quote, and drop the sentence if nothing reliable comes back.
- Every H2 section opens with a sentence that answers that heading directly, then explains, then gives what varies, then what to check.
- Each section has its own job. Say a thing once, in the section where it belongs. A client fact appears where it is relevant and at most twice on the whole page. Never recycle facts to reach a word budget; when a section needs more substance, explain the subject itself: how the practice works, what varies from case to case, what a reader should check, what goes wrong and why.

Questions this page must answer:
Readers and answer engines ask these questions. Answer each one once, inside the section where it fits best, with a direct answering sentence first and the evidence after it. Never insert a question as text, never add a question and answer block, never restate the question. The reader must not notice the question was planted.
  1. First AI prompt sent by the app?
  2. Second AI prompt sent by the app?

Client facts:
These are the only claims you may make about the client. Use them exactly and invent nothing about the client beyond them. General knowledge about the field, the practice and what buyers should look for is welcome and must never be phrased as a claim about the client.
- fact_key_1: fact value from the app
- fact_key_2: ["list","of","values"]

Hard rules for this page:
- Never invent a number, a price, a client result, a certification, a credential or a capability. If it is not in the client facts or in a Live Research result you saw, do not write it.
- Never link to the client's own website (https://example.com) and never invent an internal link. Links between the client's pages are placed by a separate process after this page is written. The only client link allowed is the CTA link described below, when there is one.
- Do not write an author line, a testimonial block, a breadcrumb, a related links block or a FAQ. Those are produced separately.
- No exclamation marks.
- Page type constraints: Specs, price and availability only from the facts; no unsupported free, guaranteed or environmental claims.

CTA:
One call to action, in the closing section only (section 4). Soft: one plain sentence in the last outline section naming how to order or ask for a quote, linked to the CTA URL. The buy button is UI and is not written. The action: CTA rule sent by the app.. Link the action to https://example.com/contact/ with a plain anchor of two to four words. That is the only link to the client's site on the page. Outside the closing section, never ask the reader to contact, book, call, schedule, sign up or get in touch, and never write "we" as the client.

- Opening paragraph: The item's title and key facts. Not a definitional answer paragraph. Then begin the first H2.
- Then these H2 sections, in this exact order, with these exact headings. Do not add, merge, rename or reorder them.
  1. First H2 from the app [122 words]
  2. Second H2 from the app [122 words]
  3. Third H2 from the app [122 words]
  4. Fourth H2 from the app [122 words]
  5. A closing H2 that you write yourself [about 100 words]. Heading: follow one of these patterns, filling any <...> from the H1 or the facts, in sentence case: How to apply. Never head it "Conclusion", "Summary", "Final thoughts" or "Key takeaways". Content: The application steps, the deadline and what happens after applying, from the facts, in 40 to 80 words, then the apply sentence.
- Formats for this page type: Responsibilities and requirements as bullets. Salary, location and hours in a two column table. Prose for the team and the role context. Decide per section from what the heading asks for. Never put a table where prose answers the heading, never pad a section with bullets, and never write a list of one or two items.

H1 (use verbatim): Sample H1 sent by the app
Core keyword: sample core keyword
Secondary keywords: secondary one, secondary two
Language: write in English.

Structure:
- Opening paragraph: The item's title and key facts. Not a definitional answer paragraph. Then begin the first H2.
- Then these H2 sections, in this exact order, with these exact headings. Do not add, merge, rename or reorder them.
  1. First H2 from the app [98 words]
  2. Second H2 from the app [98 words]
  3. Third H2 from the app [98 words]
  4. Fourth H2 from the app [98 words]
  5. A closing H2 that you write yourself [about 100 words]. Heading: follow one of these patterns, filling any <...> from the H1 or the facts, in sentence case: Check availability | How to book. Never head it "Conclusion", "Summary", "Final thoughts" or "Key takeaways". Content: The first step to get the item, what happens next and how long it takes, from the facts, in 40 to 90 words, then the CTA sentence.
- Formats for this page type: Room facts (size, beds, view, occupancy) in a table. Amenities as bullets. Prose for the description. Decide per section from what the heading asks for. Never put a table where prose answers the heading, never pad a section with bullets, and never write a list of one or two items.
- Include at least 1 markdown table where a section suits one. Real pipe tables with a header row.
- No H3 subheadings on this page type. 
- Total length: 300 to 800 words. Aim for about 550.

- Research: This page type is written from the client facts and general professional knowledge. Use the Live Research tool only when a sentence needs a specific external figure or quote, and drop the sentence if nothing reliable comes back.
- Every H2 section opens with a sentence that answers that heading directly, then explains, then gives what varies, then what to check.
- Each section has its own job. Say a thing once, in the section where it belongs. A client fact appears where it is relevant and at most twice on the whole page. Never recycle facts to reach a word budget; when a section needs more substance, explain the subject itself: how the practice works, what varies from case to case, what a reader should check, what goes wrong and why.

Questions this page must answer:
Readers and answer engines ask these questions. Answer each one once, inside the section where it fits best, with a direct answering sentence first and the evidence after it. Never insert a question as text, never add a question and answer block, never restate the question. The reader must not notice the question was planted.

- Do not write an author line, a testimonial block, a breadcrumb, a related links block or a FAQ. Those are produced separately.
- No exclamation marks.

One call to action, in the closing section only (section 5). Direct but calm: one or two plain sentences asking for the appointment in the CTA rule, linked to the CTA URL. No fear appeal, no outcome promise. The action: CTA rule sent by the app.. Link the action to https://example.com/contact/ with a plain anchor of two to four words. That is the only link to the client's site on the page.

Client: Example Client
What the client does: What the client does, as sent by the app.
H1 (use verbatim): Sample H1 sent by the app
Core keyword: sample core keyword
Secondary keywords: secondary one, secondary two
Language: write in English.

Structure:
- Opening paragraph: a direct answer of 40 to 80 words in the key facts style (The item's title and key facts). No heading above it, no preamble. It answers the question the H1 implies.
- Then these H2 sections, in this exact order, with these exact headings. Do not add, merge, rename or reorder them.
  1. First H2 from the app [330 words]
  2. Second H2 from the app [330 words]
  3. Third H2 from the app [330 words]
  4. Fourth H2 from the app [330 words]
  5. A closing H2 that you write yourself [about 100 words]. Heading: follow one of these patterns, filling any <...> from the H1 or the facts, in sentence case: Booking a consultation. Never head it "Conclusion", "Summary", "Final thoughts" or "Key takeaways". Content: What the consultation covers and how to prepare, from the facts, in 50 to 100 words, then the CTA sentence. Risks stated on the page stay stated.
- Formats for this page type: Specifications, prices, sizes, doses, coverage and comparisons in tables. Sequences as numbered steps. Inclusions and options as bullets. Descriptions and reasoning in prose. Decide per section from what the heading asks for. Never put a table where prose answers the heading, never pad a section with bullets, and never write a list of one or two items.
- Include at least 1 markdown table where a section suits one. Real pipe tables with a header row.
- H3 subheadings are required: one H3 per stage (before, during, after) or per option inside the sections that go through them. When you use H3s in a section, use at least two, phrase each as the specific sub-question or item it covers (that is what answer engines quote), keep them in sentence case, and never put an H3 in a section under 150 words. Never use H4.
- Total length: 1000 to 2000 words. Aim for about 1500.
- External citations are optional. Any you use must come from the Live Research tool.
- Research: This page type is written from the client facts and general professional knowledge. Use the Live Research tool only when a sentence needs a specific external figure or quote, and drop the sentence if nothing reliable comes back.
- Every H2 section opens with a sentence that answers that heading directly, then explains, then gives what varies, then what to check.
- Each section has its own job. Say a thing once, in the section where it belongs. A client fact appears where it is relevant and at most twice on the whole page. Never recycle facts to reach a word budget; when a section needs more substance, explain the subject itself: how the practice works, what varies from case to case, what a reader should check, what goes wrong and why.

Questions this page must answer:
Readers and answer engines ask these questions. Answer each one once, inside the section where it fits best, with a direct answering sentence first and the evidence after it. Never insert a question as text, never add a question and answer block, never restate the question. The reader must not notice the question was planted.

  2. Second AI prompt sent by the app?

Client facts:

- Never link to the client's own website (https://example.com) and never invent an internal link. Links between the client's pages are placed by a separate process after this page is written. The only client link allowed is the CTA link described below, when there is one.
- Do not write an author line, a testimonial block, a breadcrumb, a related links block or a FAQ. Those are produced separately.
- No exclamation marks.
- Page type constraints: Medical content: clinical facts from sources with year; named reviewer; candidacy, risks and recovery stated honestly; no outcome guarantees; see-a-professional line.

Readers and answer engines ask these questions. Answer each one once, inside the section where it fits best, with a direct answering sentence first and the evidence after it. Never insert a question as text, never add a question and answer block, never restate the question. The reader must not notice the question was planted.
  1. First AI prompt sent by the app?
  2. Second AI prompt sent by the app?

Client facts:
These are the only claims you may make about the client. Use them exactly and invent nothing about the client beyond them. General knowledge about the field, the practice and what buyers should look for is welcome and must never be phrased as a claim about the client.
- fact_key_1: fact value from the app
- fact_key_2: ["list","of","values"]

Hard rules for this page:
- Never invent a number, a price, a client result, a certification, a credential or a capability. If it is not in the client facts or in a Live Research result you saw, do not write it.
- Never link to the client's own website (https://example.com) and never invent an internal link. Links between the client's pages are placed by a separate process after this page is written. The only client link allowed is the CTA link described below, when there is one.
- Do not write an author line, a testimonial block, a breadcrumb, a related links block or a FAQ. Those are produced separately.
- No exclamation marks.
- Page type constraints: Regulated price and contract disclosures from the facts; speed and coverage claims as 'up to' where the facts say so.

CTA:
One call to action, in the closing section only (section 5). Direct: one or two plain sentences asking for the one action in the CTA rule, linked to the CTA URL with a two to four word anchor. The action: CTA rule sent by the app.. Link the action to https://example.com/contact/ with a plain anchor of two to four words. That is the only link to the client's site on the page. Outside the closing section, never ask the reader to contact, book, call, schedule, sign up or get in touch, and never write "we" as the client.

```text
<page_brief>
Page type: Route lane (catalogue family). Shipping route or corridor
Client: Example Client
What the client does: What the client does, as sent by the app.
H1 (use verbatim): Sample H1 sent by the app
Core keyword: sample core keyword
Secondary keywords: secondary one, secondary two
Language: write in English.

Structure:
- Opening paragraph: The item's title and key facts. Not a definitional answer paragraph. Then begin the first H2.
- Then these H2 sections, in this exact order, with these exact headings. Do not add, merge, rename or reorder them.
  1. First H2 from the app [172 words]
  2. Second H2 from the app [172 words]
  3. Third H2 from the app [172 words]
  4. Fourth H2 from the app [172 words]
  5. A closing H2 that you write yourself [about 100 words]. Heading: follow one of these patterns, filling any <...> from the H1 or the facts, in sentence case: Request a rate for this route. Never head it "Conclusion", "Summary", "Final thoughts" or "Key takeaways". Content: The first step to get the item, what happens next and how long it takes, from the facts, in 40 to 90 words, then the CTA sentence.
- Formats for this page type: Specifications, prices, sizes, doses, coverage and comparisons in tables. Sequences as numbered steps. Inclusions and options as bullets. Descriptions and reasoning in prose. Decide per section from what the heading asks for. Never put a table where prose answers the heading, never pad a section with bullets, and never write a list of one or two items.
- Include at least 1 markdown table where a section suits one. Real pipe tables with a header row.
- H3 subheadings are optional:  When you use H3s in a section, use at least two, phrase each as the specific sub-question or item it covers (that is what answer engines quote), keep them in sentence case, and never put an H3 in a section under 150 words. Never use H4.
- Total length: 500 to 1200 words. Aim for about 850.
- External citations are optional. Any you use must come from the Live Research tool.
- Research: This page type is written from the client facts and general professional knowledge. Use the Live Research tool only when a sentence needs a specific external figure or quote, and drop the sentence if nothing reliable comes back.
- Every H2 section opens with a sentence that answers that heading directly, then explains, then gives what varies, then what to check.
- Each section has its own job. Say a thing once, in the section where it belongs. A client fact appears where it is relevant and at most twice on the whole page. Never recycle facts to reach a word budget; when a section needs more substance, explain the subject itself: how the practice works, what varies from case to case, what a reader should check, what goes wrong and why.
